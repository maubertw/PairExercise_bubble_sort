//takes an array and then

//while iteration counter --- loop names a,b a = arr[i], arr[i+1]
//counter--
//outer looper for how many times to loop always starts at 1st elem: //has an iteration counter;
//inner looper for looping through each element, minus 1 each iteration;


//loop through every element, and compare higher or lower
//if any element was swapped in that iteration, then iterate again
//once a whole iteration happens with no swapping then return;
//iteration counter starts at length of the array
//on each iteration counter - 1 so you don't iterate over unnecessary ..

//compare func(a,b) return arr[0] > arr[1] //this gives true of false;


//swap function(a,b)
// var elem;

//if compare is true then swap;

// elem =arr[0];
// arr[0] = arr[1];
// arr[1] = elem;
